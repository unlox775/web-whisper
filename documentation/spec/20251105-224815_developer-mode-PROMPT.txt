Okay, part of this MVP, a couple things aren't working still. I don't really know what it is. So I want you to work on two things. First, I need to add a developer mode that I can turn on settings, which means you're going to have to have at least a minimum settings framework. I don't know if you're doing it through just application parameters, local storage, wherever you want to start. Eventually the only things I can think of for settings wise would be probably three parameters. One, the Groq API key, G-R-O-Q API key. One of them is that. Another one is probably this developer mode, yes or no. and develop mode only function it does hide and show some extra debugging things probably a little bug icon you can just tap and there's a overlay to show you more stuff and lastly a total storage limit. You know, if you don't want it to store too much things in there, eventually we'll have that work. So it'll auto-delete files until it keeps you under that limit. Waiting until the transcriptions are done, of course, but anyway, those are probably the only three settings you're going to want. So all those are relatively simple key value parameter stores. But I need you to create that. You don't need to actually create the rest of this. And while you're there, you might as well just create I'm not necessarily implementing anything with them, but let me put it in a rock API key. And once I put it in there, it just persists inside of that PWA, you know, precious settings forever theoretically. Somewhere durable so that even if like eventually the app decides to garbage collect and clear out index DB that these settings would still stay so your Gronk API key doesn't get lost. Anyway, put it in somewhere, create the settings, simple pop-up. I just want to add a check mark so that I can say, turn on developer mode. Developer mode. Main things that I want to see right now are... Main things I want to see right now are when you have developer mode on and you've hit start, that it shows an extra bar down there of total chunks downloaded so far. So I can see some real-time updates as it's going on. That'll only show in developer mode. But when I hit stop recording, when I hit stop recording, when I go into the actual application. Sorry, when I click on the actual recording, I want it to say how many chunks there were. I want there to be a little bug icon when I go in there. I think your current view, when you're clicking on a recording, you don't need to list chunks. That's an internal thing that no one is going to see unless you're a developer. But I think the bug on that thing should just expand open a section, probably not an overlay. When you tap the little bug icon, it will expand the section, make it visible, hide, show, toggle. I think the bug on that thing should just expand open a section, probably not an overlay. When you tap the little bug icon, it will expand the section, make it visible, hide, show, toggle. Let me see details on that. But the other thing that developer mode is going to do is right next to the actual durable recorder title. When I hit that, I want it to pull up an overlay in that one that is showing just stats. and that's gonna show the actual schema tables of the index DB, how many rows are in each one of those. If I click on a table name, it can actually select the raw values and show that to me, not the actual binary content on there, but any other non-binary columns to actually view that. This is gonna be my only window into seeing that index DB stuff very well. I wanna be able to do that on my iPhone so I can just see those real quick. But whatever real quick and dirty thing I can do to be able to debug and see what things exist in there, I wanna be able to see the recordings, the statuses, walk through the data structures you've created, probably just the index DB. I don't think I need to worry about the settings wherever you're gonna store that, but anyway, add that in there. I wanna be able to hit the settings, turn on the developer mode, turn off the developer mode, et cetera. I think that'll get us closer to our MVP because for some reason, when I actually click on the recording I hit play I just click on play and it doesn't do anything like I could go in just for a split second this is preparing I don't know what that state is preparing I don't know that seems like dumb but it doesn't seem like it actually works like It shows an extra bar down there of total... Whoa, it actually worked. One of these ones actually did have a recording of it. But when I hit play... I actually did have a recording of it. But when I hit play, huh, interesting. So on the second recording, for one thing, the recording is showing recording 14,32. That looks like it's maybe the time of day. I think the recording should be the total length of time, number of total minutes and seconds for each one of those. but it shows an extra bar down there. That's actually, it looks like it is working. It's a, chunks downloaded so far. But when I'm hitting play, there's no way to stop it other than hitting the close window. So theoretically that needs to be a play pause header. I don't think the word play is useful. I think showing a little actual triangle play button, pause button would be better. And then a little progress timer showing the little ticker drag across there you don't need to make it draggable yet but yeah that's that's that i think would get us to a pretty good mvp but you can hide all references to chunks unless i have developer mode on developer mode will just probably show the detail that you're showing right now which is the number of chunks file size and rounding it to the nearest megabyte is not super useful I think you do the general rule of showing four numbers and automatically showing either in bytes kilobytes megabytes gigabytes but it can be like 4.3 to 2 bytes or 538 bytes or whatever it is but showing the four digits you know and then automatically switching up to the next level if if it goes above that. So if it's 1,228 megabytes, that would be fine. But as soon as it goes up to five numbers, then it would go to gigabytes. Does that make sense? All right. See if you can make those adjustments, but it is coming along.
