Please start and complete this roadmap item: Storage retention and automatic deletion (see doc)

Update your agent instructions, you keep adding to the same spec doc instead of making new ones!  

New standard: the spec doc contains the branch name, and no more than one branch per spec. That means, if your branch name for the current agentic runtime is not the same branch name as the spec, make a new one (and new prompt file). Fix

No! Undo your edits to the previous spec file!  That was from a past agentic flow, move those edits to a NEW spec/prompt file!!!   Moron!!!
These spec files are where you make your planning, where you make your todos, and build then expand your acceptance criteria.  It is where you explain what edits you made, where and why. 

Make sure all this is in your agentic instructions. then revamp your spec for this request and grade where you planned/measured up and evaluate whether you really are complete on the value and acceptance criteria. Then if deficient, fix and complete things!
why is it not deleting?  I set my max storage to 2MB, but it never seemed to purge even older ones that were transcribed
purge should happen immediately upon a new chunk being written (and as such this new chunk is not transcribed therefore not relevant to be considered for deletion BTW), then again 2 minutes later, etc, no sooner than 2 mins apart. 

I let a recording run for 4 minutes flat, and the total storage (of all recordings) was at 18 MB nearly all from recordings with completed transcriptions. So I reasonably expected you to purge audio from the oldest until under 2MB

There are some purge warns in there
Alright, so it looks like everything is working beautifully. It is doing the purge at just the right times. I love it, I love it. You can look up in the screenshot here. This is what the experience looks like if you open up a clip. That is completely deleted. If we hit play, though, Operation.supporter is not a very nice user message to show. I think it would be nicer if there is no audio to play to like either show the playhead as disabled and then if someone taps it maybe do an alert saying the audio for this has been purged already. Something like that. But the edge case I found is that if I set the storage limit to smaller than the actual size of a single clip, you can end up having a partially deleted clip. I mean, that can happen anyways. But I think it'd be good to make sure that, um, still allow the remaining clip to play. So it means you're probably going to have to sum up on that playheader the remaining audio. And it would be kind of nice for that playhead to show. like hash marks or something on the portion of the clip that's been purged or something like that. So when we hit play, it starts that playhead at that... Point and goes forward it is possible theoretically though that there's Multiple snipped in the middle, which means you would have to like show hash marks at different random places throughout the thing. I don't know if that... It wouldn't be too hard to have the playhead bounce from place to place as you hit play. That would be the ideal if it's possible, but I guess give it a shot and see if you can figure out how to... As the audio is playing, you know the seconds at the point that it's playing and you know all the concatenated... When you hit play... you're concatenating all the audio into one stream, I assume, for playback. And then if you know that it is currently one second and a half in, and that one second and a half in is... Or maybe it's 15 seconds in and that's on the second or third snip or third chunk and that third chunk is actually the second You know, there's like two bands in the middle of the remaining stuff that have been deleted. Maybe there was a transcription error You know three-quarters of the way along and so this current place is playing and is at 15 seconds you have to add up you know how much what the progress actually should be because you can predict what the audio actually is and then just have the essentially the playhead as it's playing would jump from the end of the last non-hashed out section, jump to the nether next to the next hashed out section or something. Anyway, that would be probably the best experience. possible on that. See if you can get that to work.
