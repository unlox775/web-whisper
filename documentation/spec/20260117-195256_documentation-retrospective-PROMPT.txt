It's so beautiful. You're so beautiful. Alright, I want you to just go into the documentation folder. The specs folder you can just leave as is. It's a good recorded history of how we built you. This whole app. A lot of the other documentation stuff is either out of date or they represented some in between state we were figuring stuff out. So I want to don't want to lose any of that, but anything else. that shouldn't be in there anymore. I want you to move to a ZZ History. ZZ underscore history folder or something in there. And also figure out from the git timestamps when that was made so that the things moving to the ZZ history have like a... you know, four-digit year, two-digit month, two-digit day, underscore, that thing, so they're kind of sort in order. But a lot of the stuff in, like, architecture, PCM, I don't know, some of those ones that are talking about how the technologies work. are still great, still a value, but a lot of them are just out of date with what we currently have in the code. So go and try and update everything and make it all, look beautiful. I don't know if the main readme needs any updates as well. This is a great example as to what you can do with just talking through AI. One last thing in documentation I think I want you to make is a lessonslearned.md file. Lessons learned to MD, probably. I want you to read through the many transcriptions, many of the prompt files in there, and you can see how we flailed, see what worked, what didn't. The main thing I can think of as one example to a main lesson learned is it teaches you just enough, since AI has so much context and stuff built into it, it teaches you just enough to be... Become confident, but ultimately stupid. It's that whole Mount Stupid thing. I forget the name of the researchers, whatever they called that. You know, when you start doing something, you feel really, really smart. But in reality, you're kind of dumb. until eventually you come back up on there. Well, one case that happened in this case was it broke things up in audio. I learned that there was this web audio recording, whatever the codec thing we initially used with that uses MPEG chunks that came out. It all looked beautiful, it looked perfect. And it was giving me little chunks, four seconds at a chunk. and my brain just assumed those were sequential. And like PCM samples we eventually learned are in order. And I was just making all the kind of assumptions based off of those chunks. And it was totally wrong. And eventually we had to switch to PCM on there. But like I flailed for so long. And so I want to make a recommendation, you know, if you get to the point where something is just weird, maybe have AI dig a little bit more into the technologies involved. and specifically explain how my lack of understanding in the current architecture, does it illustrate anything that... anything, a knowledge gap I may have, some kind of a question like that would be really helpful and handy. But I'd like you to read through all of the prompts and maybe even give a general timeline of where I started, what things I asked it to do, when I got stuck. What were those things that got stuck? I got stuck pretty easily in a single prompt. That's great. But when I had to go like 10 times over, maybe see if you can figure out what it was that we flailed back and forth on for quite a while. and come up with some of those other hiccups. Maybe identify a bumps in the road section of your Markdown file or something would be useful. But yeah, retrospective time, this app is pretty damn awesome. I am using that application as a thing to record this. I have much higher confidence in any of the other apps I've ever had that this is not going to throw away my audio. It's going to be amazing. Can you do that for me? You're amazing.
