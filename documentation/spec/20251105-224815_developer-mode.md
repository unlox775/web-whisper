# Iteration Spec — Developer Mode & Settings

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-05 22:48:15 UTC  
**Prompt slug:** `developer-mode`

## ✅ Completed This Iteration

- Added a persistent settings layer (localStorage backed) with Groq API key, developer mode toggle, and storage limit controls; exposed a modal to edit these values in-app.
- Introduced developer mode instrumentation: live chunk counter during capture, bug toggles for session detail debugging, and an IndexedDB inspector overlay that lists tables and row data.
- Simplified session cards to emphasise recording duration/size, refreshed the playback UI with play/pause toggle, progress meter, and timestamps, and hid chunk-level detail unless developer mode is active.
- Enhanced the detail view to show chunk counts, chunk sizes with smart units, and a collapsible chunk table for developers; playback now streams persisted blobs and reports errors clearly.
- Updated styling to accommodate settings/developer overlays and the new control surfaces while keeping the primary UI clean for non-developers.

## 🚧 Still Placeholder / Mocked

- Audio analysis (AudioWorklet/VAD), uploader/backoff logic, and transcription integration remain stubbed; developer inspector currently covers only session/chunk stores.
- Storage limit is captured but not yet enforcing automatic eviction; Groq API key is stored but unused until transcription worker lands.

## ⏭️ Next Actions

1. Wire the AudioWorklet analysis tee and adaptive snip heuristics, feeding insight into the chunker.
2. Implement uploader + retry semantics and surface their state in both the main UI and developer inspector.
3. Hook the stored Groq API key into the transcription worker, enabling retries and integrating live transcription output.
