All right, on this web whisper thing, um, one bug that needs to be fixed and then we'll iterate on something similar. The automatic slicing of the chunks, um, choosing the quiet spots so they have nice slices for those quiet spots. I'd like you to make it so that, um, we could download and play those specific things to demonstrate how you can create the programming API to refer to things by either chunks that it was recorded in or by, um, snips. I think chunks versus snips is probably the names I'd have for them. Chunks are the natural four second chunks or whatever the, uh, the web audio API breaks it into. We can't control that, but then we do audio analysis trying to find the natural quiet spots in the audio. And for those, those snips, they're not based off of the four second. Four second chunks is the natural format that the Web Audio API gives us those, and right now the user interface, if I click on a recording and I hit the bug icon, lists each one of those chunks. That is broken right now, because if I hit the play icon, it always plays from the beginning every time, no matter what I do. I'm not sure if the download works, but that needs to get fixed, because then the next thing I want to do is on the top of that list of chunks, I want a little bubble, kind of a toggle, like a little oval that you tap and it goes left and right. I want the left side to say chunks, and that'll be what's default selected, and the right side will be snips, and if I toggle it, it'll change the list to the different snips. The snips are based off of the quiet pauses sections that you can see when you see the report debugging on that. That should list all the snips, and this should work exactly the same way when I hit play. It will be playing partial chunks, or even the end of one chunk and the beginning of another chunk in order to stitch together the audio files for each snip. Snips don't have a zero, the zeroth element that's bad like the chunks do. The chunks have their very first element as just a header, but all the other ones after that are actually useful for second chunks, or for chunks, but then the snips should always be about whatever our target lengths are for that algorithm we made, which should still be intact. The main thing I want you to do is make sure that the backend programming API for this is solid, so that you can, based off of recording, just say give me snip one, snip two, snip three, that way the frontend UI on this is relatively simple. Its outputs should have an output for the raw actual sound data. That's what will feed into the download thing, or into the playhead thing. This will be later really useful, critical, for the sake of doing our grok transcription stuff, but for right now I just want to get it so that that debug panel, when you're viewing a single thing, has the toggle between snips and chunks, and that the playheader and the download buttons work for all of those different modes. Go ahead and do that for me.
