I want you to make it so the histogram itself when the audio itself is playing above it has a moving green bar that moves along and that that panel the histogram automatically scrolls when it gets to like the three quarter point. You can still click and drag it around, but as soon as you let go it'll move it again so that the progress player bar is moving until it gets to the three-quarter point and then it starts scrolling.
