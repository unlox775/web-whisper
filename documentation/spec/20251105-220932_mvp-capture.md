# Iteration Spec — MVP Capture Loop

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-05 22:09:32 UTC  
**Prompt slug:** `mvp-capture`

## ✅ Completed This Iteration

- Re-pointed deployment output to `docs/` (for GitHub Pages) and renamed the prior writing space to `documentation/`, updating all playbook references accordingly.
- Implemented a browser-native capture controller: continuous `MediaRecorder` AAC/WebM recording, 4 s timeslices, IndexedDB chunk persistence, and graceful stop/flush handling.
- Built an IndexedDB manifest service that tracks sessions, chunks, and storage totals; exposed helpers for metadata queries, combined playback blobs, and cleanup.
- Rewired the React UI to load real session data, surface buffer usage, drive the record/stop button, show chunk lists, and enable playback directly from persisted blobs.
- Added console-backed settings + telemetry scaffolds and refreshed the status dashboard to reflect the newly-functional MVP loop.

## 🚧 Still Placeholder / Mocked

- Audio analysis tee (AudioWorklet metrics, adaptive snips) remains stubbed; recordings use fixed-interval snipping only.
- Upload worker, retry semantics, and Groq transcription integration are not yet wired; settings drawer is still view-only.
- Live transcription panel continues to show simulated text until Groq streaming lands.

## ⏭️ Next Actions

1. Introduce the AudioWorklet pipeline for RMS/ZCR analysis and adaptive boundary decisions feeding the snip queue.
2. Implement the upload worker with exponential backoff, storage pressure safeguards, and UI states for retry/attention.
3. Connect the settings drawer (Groq API key, snip sensitivity) and wire the transcription worker to batch 30 s windows.
