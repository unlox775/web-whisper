Okay. I think it's time to come up with... A list of final polish things to be done. You know there is a there is no I'm avoiding that we're going to need to port this to an iOS application soon. The main missing gap, of course, is that I want to be able to hit record and have it keep recording in the background while I switch to other applications. Because often that's how I dictate my inputs is to browse to other applications. So, I don't know if there's any way to get the progressive web app on. iOS anyways, to stay persistent so it keeps recording even when you're not on the application. But there are definitely some other things that need to be adjusted. I want you to create this as like a documentation slash roadmap maybe. Identify maybe a... List of tasks. I wanted to keep it relatively terse at this point of what it is, what the task is, what the main goals are, and two or three bullet items as to the most effective acceptance criteria to know that they're done. One feature. is we haven't implemented the data deletion process. Essentially, when you start getting closer to the limit that is set, it's not auto-deleting things. The general way I want to do the deletion is to delete oldest files first, but only deleting the audio chunk files for... chunks that are part of SNPs that have finished transcribing. And then we need to have a thing where if you do retry transcription, it won't allow a retry of those transcriptions because the chunks are gone now. So they're like locked or something. but I want this deletion to be automatic as you're recording new chunks, probably on some type of, I don't know, debounced event firing or something, like every new event fires a thing, which then causes every two minutes for it to do a deletion pass where it finds and deletes and purges old stuff to keep it under the limit. So deletion. That needs to go down eventually. I think I want to have a... Getting started slow. People need to know how to get on here, how to go and get a Grok key. You know, explaining them that the Grok API for this type of a thing is so insanely cheap. even though it will show a few cents usage even after they use it all the time. I'm sure some people will prove me wrong, but... Even after they used it as heavily as I do, which is pretty darn heavily. Um... Cough. Cough. Cough. Cough. even after I've done thousands and thousands of recordings like I have I've still never been charged It is a pay-as-you-go model, at least until they discontinue that. So it's so cheap that you... In practice, we'll never actually end up paying for the actual dictation transcription part. But it's something to walk them through the general steps of how to do that, where to go, set up the account, explain the cost worries or lack of worries, but with the disclaimer. But ultimately, when you just have a first time using this app, you're going to wonder how to get the transcription to work. We need to have a little bit better... Planned out value of the app. Assuming you haven't enabled transcription yet. I think I'd probably prefer it to be like the app has essentially two modes. Either you haven't enabled transcription or you have. And in order to enable transcription, you have to give it a valid rock key. We double-check it. And there's a state in the future where the grok key no longer seems to work, in which case they can either hit Retry to switch back to transcription-enabled mode, But when you're in transcription enabled mode, I think all the recordings should just, you know, not show transcription failed because obviously it can't. start those ones. Maybe it's like recording complete or something? I don't know. Because you can still play it. Use it as a general audio recorder. It's not very useful, but... The other thing that would be good to know, I don't think we have a download button for downloading the entire audio. That would be definitely useful to do. yeah I'm sure there's a bunch of visual improvements and such that would be good to have on here, but I don't think that I don't need to worry about those yet. I think I want to do some focus groups with some people, record what they're... response reactions are to the app, what they like, what they don't like, usability questions and such. but don't really care that much that it looks pretty you did a pretty good job enough of making it look pretty to my eyes so And that is the plan. Another feature, I guess, it's a body of work anyways. is to do some more cross-browser testing. Because I've verified that on iOS, the version that I'm using, it works. But either a different phone or a different iOS version or even a different computer like it works okay on my Chrome and brave on my desktop machine. I went to test it the other day on some other computer or a PC or something, and it did not work. I don't know what the errors were, but it's not very cross-browser compatible yet at the moment. But, anyhow, those are the main roadmap items I can think of. I want you to capture all those ones. The major roadmap item, I suppose, is iOS. I think I would just probably build iOS build. There's just a subfolder in here. I don't know. I don't know. I'll probably build it as a subfolder here. I'd want it to be as minimal as possible where I can give it my Apple credentials. But this is an open source application, so anybody should be able to plug in their Apple credentials and make a duplicate app if they want to. I just want to get a... What do they call it? Anyway. I almost have it. On Apple Developer, there's some... Initial launch pad or something. A test. I don't know the name of it. But I've used I've done iOS apps before and there's a way to like get the local signing key and they can install it locally on your one machine Because you have that local identity set up or whatever Let's you actually have it on your machine And then eventually put it to the app store. I don't think I ever intend to charge money for it. Paying my $100 a year Apple fee is good enough for me. I think for support, I would just say if you have any issues, go submit it on the GitHub repository. And if anyone wants to help fix it... then I encourage them to use AI. I've got all the history of all the prompts and how I built this thing recorded on AI in the history. So... I encourage anybody to go on there and just talk to AI and see if you can fix the bugs. I think I probably will consider merging it in. I don't know. It's not my goal to... Yeah, it's not really my goal to keep, to whittle off a little bit of my time to maintain this thing. So I would probably need someone else as the main maintainer of this. So, anyway. I'm just sharing it because the joy of using AI and having to create tools for you should also have some kind of a... where you can dump those tools to the rest of the world. I've built so many of these that I can't afford the effort of trying to port. to dilute my time to the community maintenance support of these I build these tools so that I can use them not really for the sake of you know creating a passion project that I want to be on forever more utility and usefulness than anything else. Anyway, I'd want to explain all that stuff. So you can probably capture that in the roadmap of my intent and plan to long-term maintenance and such. Yeah. I'll probably make sure the main repository readme is up to date with some of these roadmap plans as well. But, yeah. Thank you. Thank you.
