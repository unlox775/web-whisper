All right now I have another ask for you to get to tell you here. This is more of a question on your general knowledge of audio waveforms and just concepts of this. What I'm seeing is that the noise floor, I don't know if that is done handled by a compression or something, but it just keeps changing like i'll see a point where for like a three or four second section it'll be quiet if i have the audio turned up nice and loud i can hear there's a background hum which must be the hum of my computer monitor or maybe a hardware fan or something on there really nice and low sizzle sound and i can see it's at, I don't know if we're logarithmic here, but it's pretty low. Like I can see the overall volume is down to the, vertically it's about at the 15-20% line. I'll say 15% from the bottom. So that's, it's pretty close to the bottom. And then about less than a half second later, it jumps up to a whole new plateau that's more like 40 percent so jump from like 15 percent to 40 percent but i'm listening to the audio now that i'm seeing the playheader go across that there's no actual difference in the audio output i don't know if there's a waveform analysis thing you can do this would theoretically be in your volume control thing So I going to need you to have it recalculate. Maybe add like a version or something like that of your volume calculation, trunk volume model. And if anything is an older version, then it will automatically trigger a a regeneration to the newer version. That way when I ship, you can have it regenerate the volume map on here. There must be another way to get that minimum volume thing is I don't know if it's, if you need to do a gating on your audio analysis to not just grab, I mean, maybe there's like a really low thing that's adding higher volume on it or something like that, but your volume is not actually increasing, but yet on my bar, it's going from 15%, jumping up to 40% and staying there. There's no actual perceptible audio difference that I can tell before it jumped from 15% up to 40%. I'm guessing there's an audio gating or something you have to do to filter out to make sure that when you're coming up with volume, that it's a little more true to human ear experience rather than, I don't know, something that is really loud, but either really high out of my hearing range or really low out of my hearing range. And so maybe there is high volume, but I just can't hear it or something. I don't know. There is some audio waveform analysis you probably gotta do to make sure our volume noises are pretty close to human perception of these things.
