Bizarre. So next iteration, just monitoring maintenance improvements and stuff here. First, I'm not using this web whisper thing as my regular daily driver for at least when I'm away from my computer. I think we need to add some type of a thing in the Progressive Web App that keeps the phone awake. When I was using it for a long recording after three or four minutes, the phone went to sleep. When I did that, it paused the web app, so it stopped recording. I thought maybe the recording and the microphone being active would automatically keep it live, but evidently it doesn't. So that needs to be fixed. The other thing that happened, and I think it's, I don't know if it's related to that or what, but I've seen this issue quite a few times over the last couple months as we've been building this thing. Every once in a while, something will happen. And then I want to go to open up this web app. I've seen it both when I load the WebWhisper as a web application. as well as like loading like the Safari browser or Chrome browser or Brave browser When I load it that way, instead of loading it, I've actually installed it as a progressive web app. It has a normal app icon on my iPhone as well. But I've had it in both modes. When I come in, you hit record. It will show the little icon on the top that it's got a microphone on for a second, and then it'll just disappear. I don't know what's happening internally. I don't know if there are... internal JavaScript errors that would be reported that I'm just not seeing. I can't see the web console on the iPhone. But something happens. And the result is that it never actually gets any audio. We have that starting thing that now waits until the PCM sample actually starts coming in and that essentially never gets in. It waits 15 seconds and then it does the flashing thing to say, here, not getting in the audio. So that sucks, ultimately. So first issue is let's have something active. I know there's something we can do to keep the phone active. So, you know, for example, if you're playing a movie or something, it knows that it's something active and it won't turn off your screen and the phone go to sleep. We need to do that while there's an active recording going. The other thing, you know, when this weird thing happens, when it's refusing to load, when it's refusing to... Let the microphone actually connect. You know, I can see that part of it is trying, you know, it shows the microphone icon for a second, but it doesn't get it. There's got to be some console error that we can capture. I'm thinking the best way to do this would be to capture any, maybe just have a second capture that's capturing any, trapping any errors that happen on anything on these web pages. And then, on event that the, you know, maybe the second that I hit the record button, we keep track of that timestamp, and then on the event that we get the... 15 seconds has passed and it's still showing the starting thing and then it flashes it three times. That would be a great idea to take whatever logs have happened since that point in time and output that into the regular debugging log. saying it wasn't able to start it, its normal log report that's going to be saying it couldn't start it, but then also flashing or doing any background things that it captured during that. time phase. Maybe we'll add more debugging later if that still doesn't catch it, but I'm hoping that change will make it so next time that happens I'll have something I can debug. I mean, another possibility is if we're doing this and you can, this sounds familiar to you, you know, something that progressive web apps or web pages instead sometimes need to overcome. to actually get the, like, if there's, like, a permissions thingy on either iPhone or WebKit, you know, internal stuff. whatever it is that whatever that internal thing is if there's something I need to be doing then let's start doing that but it's really annoying I had to stop using this thing so when they do to get this it does not go away not for a while anyway I can on phone I can turn it off I can kill the app, I can open the app, I can turn the phone off, turn the phone back on again. I haven't been able to do anything. I think I even rebooted the phone once. completely shut off and completely turned back on and it still wasn't working. I thought for sure it was something that changed in the code, but it just appears to be something in the iOS subsystem of which things it allows to use a microphone or doesn't. I have no idea. But I'm hoping by adding debugging, we'll learn more about this specific issue. And with that, armed with that, next time this happens, I can just look at the application logs. paste that in and we can come up with a plan to fix that. Anyway, those are two just conditions of using this application that have had some hiccups. So, I want you to see if you can fix those, add some debugging, and have something to keep it alive while we're doing a recording. Several times as I've done this recording, it's already tried to shut it off. So, anyway, that is what I want you to do. Thank you.
