Alright, I want you to affix a couple oddities and bugs. First, um... In the starting thing, when we get stuck, that just happens every once in a while. Right now I have to wait a whole 15 seconds in order to give up. So I want either some little thing underneath it, that if it's stuck at starting, at least for a couple seconds. It might be good just to have a, I don't know, maybe it's more like a text link, something like that. If it doesn't start after a few seconds, click here to cancel or something. Anyway, some way I can abort the whole starting thing and not wait the full 15 seconds. I can tell right away at the beginning. It would also be good if after five seconds, we start playing a, you know, a triple... quieter triple dot or something like that. And then every five seconds after that, or five seconds and ten seconds, maybe even after three seconds, like a little dot dot dot. And every three seconds after that until we get up to the 15th seconds, in which case we do the bigger beep. Beep. maybe even the flash the screen, um, more softly, after three seconds, and then six seconds, and then nine seconds, flashing it louder and louder, you know, um, and then the final big flash at 15, um, anyway, Another oddity is that in the starting thing... In recording it doesn't show... No, that's true, it does. I can click into the thing that's recording as it's still recording, which is fine. It's nifty. But it shows the trash can icon in there while it's still in the middle of recording. I think that button is non-functional. If you click on it, it doesn't do anything. So I wouldn't want to show it while it's still recording in progress. Also, the... while we're stuck in that starting dot dot dot it also shows a trash can both the the main recording list. Well, it's in that still starting or whatever. It's still showing a trash can there, as well as a trash can when I go into it. Neither one of those work. I think it's okay to leave those there in that starting thing as kind of a secondary way to cancel. But right now I need to be wired up to a cancel operation rather than a delete operation. Right now if you click on either one of those, that just don't do anything. So, only while it's in that starting up thing. Uh, showing the trashcan in the main list is fine. And in the other one it's fine. Maybe change it from a trash can to an X icon or something would be better. Something that connotes cancel. You can choose the icon. But, yeah, update that, please.
