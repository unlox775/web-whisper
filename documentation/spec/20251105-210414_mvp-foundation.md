# Iteration Spec — MVP Foundation

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-05 21:04:14 UTC  
**Prompt slug:** `mvp-foundation`

## ✅ Completed This Iteration

- Renamed deployable build output to `pwa-public/` and updated Vite config so GitHub Pages can still publish the bundle while freeing `documentation/` for specifications.
- Established collaboration guardrails in `agents.md` and stood up the `documentation/spec/` logging pattern (paired spec/prompt files).
- Moved architecture notes to `documentation/architecture.md` and published `documentation/README.md` with an honest traffic-light status of every major feature.
- Tightened the UI shell: trimmed header chrome, simplified cards, reduced spacing, added a detail drawer stub, and made live transcription simulate streaming text during a recording.

## 🚧 Still Placeholder / Mocked

- Capture pipeline, chunk persistence, playback, transcription, settings, telemetry — all runtime behavior remains stubbed; UI is still driven by mocked session data.
- Recording detail view surfaces “Play (stub)” and “Transcription not yet implemented” messaging; no audio storage or playback exists yet.
- Buffer indicator reports computed mock totals; IndexedDB storage is not wired.

## ⏭️ Next Actions

1. Scaffold TypeScript modules under `src/modules/` for capture, storage, upload, transcription, and analysis (with message bus contracts) so the MVP capture loop has real seams to connect.
2. Implement the MVP capture loop: continuous `MediaRecorder` AAC recording, fixed-duration snipping (e.g., 4 s), chunk persistence in IndexedDB, and playback from stored blobs.
3. Expand the recording detail view to list recorded chunks, surface storage usage, and prepare slots for future transcription output and retry actions.
