# Contributor roadmap (optional)

These items are valuable but not planned for the core roadmap. Community
contributions are welcome. Use AI assistance as needed and keep changes modular.

## 1) Android native wrapper
Task: Build a minimal Android wrapper for background recording and store publishing.
Goals: Provide parity with iOS background audio support for Android users.
Acceptance criteria:
- Background recording works reliably on a representative Android device.
- Build instructions exist for local signing and Play Store submission.

## 2) Localization (non-English UI + transcription)
Task: Add localization for UI strings and expand language support for transcription.
Goals: Allow use beyond English while keeping defaults simple.
Acceptance criteria:
- UI strings are centralized and at least one non-English locale is supported.
- Users can select a transcription language (or auto-detect) in settings.
